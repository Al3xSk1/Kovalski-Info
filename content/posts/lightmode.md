While many modern interfaces default to dark mode, this site embraces a high-clarity light design. Research in visual ergonomics shows that for most reading-focused experiences | especially those with longer blocks of text | dark text on a light background supports superior readability, more accurate color perception, and lower cognitive load. It mirrors what our eyes are naturally accustomed to in print and daylight environments, helping you stay focused on the content rather than the interface.

Additionally, light mode ensures consistent accessibility across screens, display calibrations, and lighting conditions. Dark interfaces can introduce challenges for color-blind users, reduce contrast in bright environments, and produce more visible flicker and haloing on certain monitors. By opting for a thoughtfully crafted light-first design, this site prioritizes legibility, inclusivity, and a friction-free reading experience | so everything you see is as clear and intentional as the work behind it.
