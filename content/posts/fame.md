## Why Buy a Go-Kart?

**Why not?**

## The *Stodd Reaper* @ WPI | A Campus Legend

During my first week of A-Term at WPI, I made a simple decision:  
**buy a go-kart.**

No committees. No approvals. Just an engine, four wheels, and a campus quad.  
It was fast, loud, and honestly? Ridiculously fun.

I carved laps around campus like it was a miniature Nürburgring, and for a moment, I became something bigger than a freshman with too much audacity and $600 to burn:

I became **The Reaper**.

A fast-paced, daring student with a machine beneath him.  
Engineering with style.  
Taking lines around Stoddard Quad that history will never forget.

All good things find their limit, though.  
Go-karts have since been officially banned on campus | for reasons I’ll leave to the imagination.

But the story?  
The story stuck.

The **mythos of the Reaper** outlives the machine.

## Beyond a Meme

People still call me *The Reaper @ WPI* | a campus micro-celeb  
and the unofficial Patron Saint of Speed.

But a friend recently said something that hit different:

> *“I want to know you for you | not what the world thinks of you.”*

And they’re right.

I engineered the Reaper.  
But **I am not defined by him**.

## The Reaper Was the Beginning | Not the Destination

The Reaper built hype.  
He got people watching.  
He put me on the map.

This post isn’t just about a go-kart or a nickname.  
It’s a marker:

> **The Reaper does cool stunts.  
> Alex builds the future.**

I’m not aiming to be the fastest around a college quad.  
I’m aiming to **change the world** | through systems, technology, innovation, and a little bit of rebellion when needed.

## Long Live the Legend  

But Make Way for What Comes Next

The Reaper isn’t gone.  
He’s just become a **brand**, a legend, a mascot for disruption.

But the **age of Alex** has begun |  
and this time, the engine isn’t 212cc gasoline…

…it’s **vision**.
