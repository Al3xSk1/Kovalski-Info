*November 2025*

Welcome to the first official devlog for **Epoch MC** — a private, work-in-progress Minecraft server project I’ve been building behind the scenes for the past few months.

This isn’t a traditional SMP, and it isn’t a towny clone. Epoch MC is a **player-driven geopolitical sandbox** where nations rise and fall based on what players *actually do* — not what an admin scripted.

The goal:  
Create a world where **every action has political, economic, or military consequences**.

## What *is* Epoch MC?

A survival multiplayer server built around:

- **Nation Formation & Territory Control**  
  Players can legally claim land, negotiate borders, and expand strategically — or violently.

- **Real Economic Simulation**  
  Custom **PostgreSQL-powered** economy plugin (built by me), meaning:
  - Stable currency stored in a real database  
  - Production creates true economic power  
  - Nations rise through industry, not arbitrary “server shops”

- **Governance & Diplomacy**
  Constitutions, elections, courts, treaties — all driven by in-game systems.

- **War & Conflict Systems**
  When diplomacy fails, consequences turn kinetic. Warfare affects territory, reputation, and history.

This is a **grand-strategy MMO inside Minecraft**.

## Why This Project?

I’ve always wanted a server where:
- Admins don’t choose who wins
- Nations form naturally
- Drama happens because of *players*, not plugins
- A server becomes a **living story**

Most servers either handhold players or create artificial rules.  
Epoch MC aims to **let the world evolve organically**.


## Current Progress

✅ Custom economy backend  
✅ Nation creation and relation system    

In active development:
- United Nations-like system
- Custom economy frontend

Planned next:
- Researching and Industrialization system
- Military conflict mechanics

## Closed Development — For Now

The server is currently **in development and private**, with early testing limited to a small circle of friends.

A public alpha will come later — only once the core systems feel meaningful and fun.

If you’re reading this, you’re already ahead of the world.

## The Vision

A persistent world where kingdoms rise, neighbors feud, alliances secure peace, and **history is written by the players who show up**.

Every new settlement could be the next great empire…  
or the spark that ignites a global war.

This is just the beginning.  
More devlogs coming soon.
