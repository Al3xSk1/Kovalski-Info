## My Custom Major at WPI

I’m designing a custom BS/MS degree at WPI called Quantitative Financial Systems Engineering, focused on the future of algorithmic finance. The program combines advanced mathematics, high-performance computing, and quantitative finance to engineer the systems that power modern financial markets — from real-time trading models to AI-driven risk engines. I built this major because finance today isn’t just about business — it’s a computational and mathematical discipline, and I want to help develop the technology that drives it.
