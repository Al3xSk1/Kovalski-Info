## Drone Photogrammetry (Approval Pending)

This drone photogrammetry project aims to create a high-resolution, 3D map of the WPI campus using UAV imaging and modern reconstruction techniques. By capturing precise aerial imagery and processing it into an accurate digital model, the project will produce an open and versatile asset that can support institutional planning, accessibility improvements, research applications, and creative student initiatives. In addition to contributing a valuable resource to WPI, the team is also personally motivated to use the final dataset as the foundation for an interactive racing game set on campus-merging engineering, geospatial science, and entertainment into a unified project with both practical and innovative outcomes.

### New Map of WPI (Drone Photogrammetry dependent)

The potential outcomes of the drone photogrammetry project extend well beyond producing a visually impressive model. A precise 3D reconstruction of WPI’s campus can serve as a critical asset for future research in autonomy, urban planning, and virtual simulation. Campus organizations could use it for accessibility route mapping, event planning, infrastructure studies, or enhanced campus navigation. Academic departments could leverage the data for coursework and experiments in robotics, civil engineering, and computer science. Additionally, the model opens the door to innovative outreach opportunities, such as immersive virtual tours for prospective students or interactive gaming and VR experiences developed by the student community. This project lays the foundation for a digital twin of WPI; an evolving, reusable resource that can grow alongside the institution and its students.

## Epoch MC (WIP)

Epoch MC is a large-scale, persistent Minecraft server project built to simulate a living, evolving world where nations rise, economies fluctuate, and players shape history through their collective decisions. Designed around deep systems rather than simple gameplay loops, it features dynamic land ownership, a fully-modeled economy backed by a custom Postgres-powered plugin, diplomatic structures like a United Nations-style council, environmental mechanics that track climate and resource impact, and a research tree that advances civilization toward modern technology such as vehicles and aircraft. With courts, elections, markets, militaries, and infrastructure all governed by player action and server-driven rules, Epoch MC is not just a server; it's a sandbox society where every choice has meaning and the world remembers what you do.

### Robo Term (WIP)

Robo-Term is a trading interface and automation system designed primarily for Minecraft, built to integrate seamlessly with the custom Economize backend that powers the game’s economy. Through a clean web UI, players can monitor prices, trade commodities and currencies, manage bank accounts and portfolios, and even automate strategies. Bringing real financial tools into a game environment. Rather than relying on simple shop chests or NPCs, Robo-Term turns the economy into a dynamic, player-driven market where supply, demand, and smart decision-making determine success. It’s built for Minecraft first, but inspired by real-world financial technology-making gameplay deeper, more competitive, and more immersive.

## My Custom Major at WPI (WIP)

I’m designing a custom BS/MS degree at WPI called Quantitative Financial Systems Engineering, focused on the future of algorithmic finance. The program combines advanced mathematics, high-performance computing, and quantitative finance to engineer the systems that power modern financial markets; from real-time trading models to AI-driven risk engines. I built this major because finance today isn’t just about business; it’s a computational and mathematical discipline, and I want to help develop the technology that drives it.
