**Hi, I’m Alexander Kovalski** | a technologist with a passion for **math, money, and machines**. I’m currently pursuing\* a **BS/MS in Quantitative Financial Systems Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute**, where I focus on applying analytical thinking and computation to solve real-world, tech-driven challenges.

I’m driven by curiosity and enjoy learning at the intersection of **computer science, data, and emerging technologies**. Whether I’m building software, supporting IT infrastructure, or enhancing digital experiences, I aim to create value through practical solutions and continuous improvement.

## My Interests

I love exploring:

- Applied mathematics and data science  
- Software development and automation  
- Network & system security  
- Technology that improves the way people work and interact

## Beyond the Screen

You’ll often find me experimenting with new tools, building projects that challenge me, or learning something completely new just because it seems interesting.

## Let’s Connect

I’m always open to new opportunities and conversations. Feel free to reach out — let’s build something great together.
